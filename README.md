## Bugs 
* We all hate Bugs .....cautions there might be a few bugs her and there as you interact with the application .
* How to go about it :
- Contact the owner of the project (thats me )to add you as a collaborator on the project
- Clone the repo to your machine 
- Create a new branch giving  it the name of the feature or bug you are trying to implement 
- push Your code to github



## Behaviour Driven Development
- Signin into the application to upload your own projects.
- Upload projects for viewing  
- view projects by other users 
- rate projects based on design , content, userbilty 
- View profile 

# installation 

* First you need to have a virtual environment running where you wil install tall the packages listed in requirements.txt

- Clone the project to your desired folder 
- You can use any db of your choice for this case i used (postgres) 
- Make changes in the project settings to ensure that your db is being picked  
- After you have configured your makemigrations .
- Then migrate.
- You can now run the server and see whether the project is being picked .
